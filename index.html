                    <h4>Recycle Better in New York</h4>
                    <p>Intellibins is an app we started with Sandy Woodruff, Katherine Hurley and Prat Tanapaisankit which started as a Google Glass application at a Google Glass Hackathron by UbiTech in New York. After the hackathon, we decided to pursue the idea further and register our startup as a legal company. Currently, we have apps on the Apple App Store and on the Google Play Store, and we’re still working on making them better. </p>

                    <h4>Pace University New York</h4>
                    <p>Dr. Christelle Scharff, Chair of the Computer Science Department at Pace University, and I started the Mobile & Wearable Meetups to engage people in learning how to develop for mobile devices and wearables such as iOS, Android, Google Glass and more. This was a group for anyone interested in mobile and wearable technology, and being a Pace University student was not a requisite.</p>

                    <h4>Graduation Project at Pace University</h4>
                    <p>Everyday is the app I created for Google Glass as my graduation project. It used the Google Mirror API and it was completely a web based app that sent notifications for users with Google Glass if there was a holiday every day. The user could specify the time for each notification and the card sent allowed people to share the holiday through Twitter app.
                        Created in Java, and using MySQL as the primary database it was hosted in Amazon’s AWS. Currently, the app is not live due to the dwindling use of Google Glass, but the entire code is open source and can be seen on Github.</p>

                    <p>In a Microsoft Women’s Hackathon at Pace, Nivedita Joshi, Patrice Minott and I developed a Windows Phone 8 app in C# that tracks teens driving. The worries of parents when their teens are driving are really high nowadays and this app allows the phone to track the speed, time of arrival and geolocation of the driver and sends an SMS to parents’ or guardians’ phone for safe measure. </p>

            <h2>Passions</h2>
            <p>I’m absolutely passionate about developing software. I love delivering high quality products and the whole creative process of making it. I consider myself a very happy and active person who likes to say yes to new projects and experiences. Nothing can replace the thrill to learn something new or work on a new project.</p>
            <p>My passion for coding started out very early and without realizing that I liked it as much as I do. When I was around 12 years old, I used to spend a lot of time on the Nickelodeon forums for shows like “Hey Arnold!” or “Rugrats”. The forums allowed the person to create customizable names using CSS and HTML. It amazed me how regular text could be changed into a “Word Art” (yeah, we used those all the time) with a few lines of code. But it wasn’t until I was a senior in high school that I decided to pursue my passion for computing at UNITEC with a Computer Systems Engineering Degree.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>Even though I am a full-time developer by day, I’m also a Nail Art designer by night. Nail art allows me to be creative in a micro-way. I don’t do other people’s nails, I just enjoy doing my own for recreation. It’s been a hobby since I left high school and it’s extremely relaxing for me. Here’s some of the designs I’ve worn over time.</p>
            <p>My second favorite hobby is reading. I love getting lost in a book and my challenge of books to read this year is 70. You can follow my book reading progress at <a href="http://goodreads.com">goodreads.com</a> </p>
