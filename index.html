                            Tanapaisankit which started as a Google Glass application at a Google Glass Hackathon
                            by UbiTech in New York. After the hackathon, we decided to pursue the idea further and
                            register our startup as a legal company. Currently, we have apps on the Apple App Store
                            and on the Google Play Store, and we’re still working on making them better. </p>

                        <h4>Pace University New York</h4>
                        <p>Dr. Christelle Scharff, Chair of the Computer Science Department at Pace University, and
                            I started the Mobile & Wearable Meetups to engage people in learning how to develop for
                            mobile devices and wearables such as iOS, Android, Google Glass and more. This was a group
                            for anyone interested in mobile and wearable technology, and being a Pace University student was not a requisite.</p>

                        <h4>Graduation Project at Pace University</h4>
                        <p>Everyday is the app I created for Google Glass as my graduation project. It used the Google Mirror
                            API and it was completely a web based app that sent notifications for users with Google Glass if
                            there was a holiday every day. The user could specify the time for each notification and the card sent allowed people to share the holiday through Twitter app.
                            Created in Java, and using MySQL as the primary database it was hosted in Amazon’s AWS. Currently, the app is not live due to the dwindling use of Google Glass, but the entire code is open source and can be seen on Github.</p>

                        <h4>Windows Phone Mobile App</h4>
                        <p>In a Microsoft Women’s Hackathon at Pace, Nivedita Joshi, Patrice Minott and I developed a Windows Phone 8 app in C# that tracks teens driving. The worries of parents when their teens are driving are really high nowadays and this app allows the phone to track the speed, time of arrival and geolocation of the driver and sends an SMS to parents’ or guardians’ phone for safe measure. </p>

                        <h4>Product Development Project at Aalto University in Finland</h4>
                        <p>Buoycast is a project created by students from Aalto University and Pace University in New York through PDP, Product Development Project.
                            It is a proposed solution for surface-to-surface communications in places with low energy and extreme conditions. It comes from the
                            "message in a bottle" idea in the sea. It's built like a small encased Intel Edison with batteries that can re-charge themselves.
                            The Intel Edison would be capable of communicating to nearby Buoycasts and transfer messages across longer distances using
                            multiple devices.</p>

                designer by night. Nail art allows me to be creative in a micro-way. I don’t do other people’s
                nails, I just enjoy doing my own for recreation. It’s been a hobby since I left high school
                and it’s extremely relaxing for me. Here’s some of the designs I’ve worn over time.</p>
